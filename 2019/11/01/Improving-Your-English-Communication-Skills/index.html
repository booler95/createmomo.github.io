<p><strong>Example (Low Context Writer —&gt; High Context Reader)</strong><br><strong><em>Original Email</em></strong><br>Hey Chung,<br><br>How are you doing? I wanted to touch base with you about the meeting we had last week. You mentioned your boss might be interested in purchasing our new product, and I wanted to know if you talked with him about it. Let me know the latest news.<br><br>Talk to you soon,<br>Sally</p>
<p><strong><em>Revised Email</em></strong><br>Dear <strong>Mr. Kim, (the reader and the boss is more formal using Mr. with the last name, instead of first names)</strong><br><br>How are you? How is the weather in Seoul these days? It is getting very cold here in Atlanta. We even had our first snowfall yesterday. <strong>(the email starts off with a personalised introduction and the overall language is more indirect and polite)</strong><br><br>I <strong>would like</strong> to discuss with you about the meeting we had last week. It was a very good meeting, and we were able to go over many important points. I remember that you mentioned your boss, <strong>Mr. Lee</strong>, maybe interested in purchasing our new product, and I <strong>would like to know</strong> if you had a chance to talk to him about it. <strong>Would you mind</strong> letting me know the latest news? I would really appreciate it.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Sally Hansen<br><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
